**About myself:**

I am a second-year undergraduate student of the department of Computer Science and Engineering, enrolled in its B.Tech course. My hobbies include watching anime, reading manga, playing CSGO, and listening to music.\
I am a weeb who hasn't watched the 'Big 5' anime like AOT, FMA, JJK, etc. I'm more into the romance genre. Apart from that, I'm a manga/hwa/hua reader too, having read about 10k+ chapters.\
I am a backend enthusiast. I don't get much time to learn more about backend-related skills (primarily due to course studies), but I try to utilize whatever time I get. I want to make backend my area of strength alongside DSA.

**Tech Experience:**

- Basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Basics of Node.js and MongoDB, which pertains to the creation of servers with the ability to handle GET and POST requests, and storing data from the client in a database of MongoDB
- C, Java, and C++, with C being the one I'm most proficient in.
- Advanced Java: Basics of Networking, Concurrency, the SPRING Framework (Have done only a part of this like setting up a server displaying an HTML, and storing data in MySQL. I'm more comfortable with Node.js and MongoDB in these areas).

**About this task:**

I found the task to be quite interesting, since the last thing I had learned was setting up a MongoDB database and storing data manually in it. So I learned about how to add data via JS and completed the task. In this process, I was able to revise the concepts of basic CSS to make the form look a bit pleasant to the eyes. I also learned about a few new things, such as 'Access-control-Allow-Origin': '*', how to change the type of a form element dynamically (text type onblur, date type onfocus) etc.\
Overall, it was a pretty enjoyable task.

**Projects:**

I haven't made a full-fledged project yet, I'm hoping to develop my skills more by being a part of MASK to create a good project.\
However, I do have a repository called [Words of Beauty](https://github.com/destryptor/Words-of-Beauty.git) which may not count as a project, but contains a simple Java program to add quotes from any sources into a text file which is accessible to all.

Please feel free to provide me feedback and let me know if I need to make any changes to the current state of the task submission. I'll be glad to do so.\
Thank you!
