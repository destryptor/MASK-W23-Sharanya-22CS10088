<div>About myself: 
  <p>
  I am a second-year undergraduate student of the department of Computer Science and Engineering, enrolled in its B.Tech course. My hobbies include watching anime, reading manga, playing CSGO and listening to music.<br>
  I am a weeb who hasn't watched the 'Big 5' anime like AOT, FMA, JJK etc. I'm more into the romance genre. Apart from that, I'm a manga/hwa/hua reader too, having read about 10k+ chapters.<br>
  I am a backend enthusiast. I don't get much time to learn more about backend-related skills (primarily due to course studies), but I try to utilise whatever time I get. I want to make backend my area of strength alongside DSA.

  About this task:
  <p>I found the task to be quite interesting, since the last thing I had learnt was setting up a MongoDB database and store data manually in it. So I learnt about how to add data via JS and completed the task. In this process, I was able to revise the concepts of basic CSS to make the form look a bit pleasant to the eyes. I also learnt about a few new things, such as  'Access-control-Allow-Origin': '*', how to change the type of a form element dynamically (text type onblur, date type onfocus) etc. <br>
    Overall, it was a pretty enjoyable task.

  Projects: 
  <p>I haven't made a full-fledged project yet, I'm hoping to develop my skills more by being a part of MASK to create a good project.<br>
  However, I do have a repository called <a href="https://github.com/destryptor/Words-of-Beauty.git" target="_blank">Words of Beauty</a> which may not count as a project, but contains a simple Java program to add quotes from any sources into a text file which is accessible to all.

  Please feel free to provide me feedback and let me know if I need to make any changes to the current state of the task submission. I'll be glad to do so.<br>
  Thank you!
